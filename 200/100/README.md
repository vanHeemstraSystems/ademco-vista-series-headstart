***WARNING***: Do NOT plug in the AC Power Supply in countries that have 220 Volt (e.g. Europe), unless you have placed the 230 V AC to 110 V AV Convertor in between to handle power. Otherwise your system may be damaged! The AC Power Supply is designed for 110 Volt (e.g. United States of America).

- This control will not power-up unless AC power is connected (will not power-up on battery alone). However, once the system is powered up, it will operate on battery power in the event of AC loss.
