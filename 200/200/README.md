## 200 - AC Power, Battery, and Ground Connections

### 1361-GT Transformer


### Battery Connections

1. Place the 12-volt backup battery in the cabinet.

2. After all connections to the control are completed and AC power has been applied, connect the red and the black flying leads on the control board to the battery. ***Do not attach these leads to the battery terminals until all connections are completed.***

### Battery Saver Feature

The battery will disconnect from the system after its voltage decreases below 9VDC. This assists the control panel in recharging the battery when AC is restored.

**IMPORTANT**: The panel will not power up initially on battery power only. You must plug the transformer in first, and then connect the battery.
